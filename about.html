            <h1>ABOUT CAROL</h1>
            <span> Carol hails from the City of Windsor, Ontario ,Canada. She attended the University of Windsor. She
                did many
                courses at the University in Drama, Arts and Education. Carol obtained an Honours in Drama and a
                Bachelors
                of Education. She is a well known and respected member of her community.</span>

            <span> Carol was always interested in Arts, Drawing, Sketching and Painting. Before the start of the
                Covid-19
                pandemic, her interest in being an artist was at the forefront for a new career and she has continued to
                do
                so on a daily basis since. She is looking forward to having her paintings in various galleries, and
                continues to develop her skills as an Abstract Painter.</span>

            <span>“When you see my art and my collection , I am trusting that you will want to have one of my paintings
                hanging on your wall to inspire you. I am learning to align myself , my mind, my heart, my soul and my
                strength with my spirit. My art has helped me to do this and it gets easier everyday.”- Carol</span>

            <span> My body of work continues to grow on a daily basis and with every brush stroke, I am inspired to
                create
                original abstract painting on canvas.</span>

            <span> We are the light of the world, you and I .Some paintings,when you see them, will move you to share
                with your
                friends and families and on social media. I promise you that my paintings will get you to move and
                search
                your heart and minds to do the things you love and you will share your talent with others in the near
                future.</span>
